# TabMetadata

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**anchor** | **String** | An optional string that is used to auto-match tabs to strings located in the documents of an envelope. | [optional] 
**anchorCaseSensitive** | **String** | This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the &#x60;anchorString&#x60; property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.  For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is &#x60;DocuSign&#x60;, then &#x60;DocuSign&#x60; will match but &#x60;Docusign&#x60;, &#x60;docusign&#x60;, &#x60;DoCuSiGn&#x60;, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, &#x60;DocuSign&#x60;, &#x60;Docusign&#x60;, &#x60;docusign&#x60;, &#x60;DoCuSiGn&#x60;, etc. will all match.  This functionality uses the following rules:  - Unless punctuation is specified in the &#x60;anchorString&#x60;, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:    $~&gt;&lt;|^+&#x3D;    For example, the &#x60;anchorString&#x60; &#x60;water&#x60; will match on the string &#x60;Fetch a pail of water.&#x60;  - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.  - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.    Example: If the anchor string is &#x60;forget&#x60;, then an anchor tab is placed on the &#x60;forget&#x60; in &#x60;forget-me-not&#x60;, even when &#x60;anchorMatchWholeWord&#x60; is set to **true**.  - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.  - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.    Example: If the anchor string is &#x60;i&#x60;, then only one anchor tab is placed in &#x60;skiing&#x60;.  - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.    Example: If the anchor string is &#x60;cat&#x60;, then &#x60;-cat-&#x60; is matched but &#x60;1cat2&#x60; is not when &#x60;anchorMatchWholeWord&#x60; is set to **true** (its default value).  **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

**anchorHorizontalAlignment** | **String** | This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :  - &#x60;left&#x60;: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value. - &#x60;right&#x60;: Aligns the tabâ€™s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.  **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.  [AnchorTabs]: https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/concepts/tabs#autoplace  | [optional] 
**anchorIgnoreIfNotPresent** | **String** | When set to **true**, this tab is ignored if the &#x60;anchorString&#x60; is not found in the document. | [optional] 
**anchorMatchWholeWord** | **String** | When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the &#x60;anchorString&#x60; property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.  For example, when set to **true**, if the input is &#x60;man&#x60; then &#x60;man&#x60; will match but &#x60;manpower&#x60;, &#x60;fireman&#x60;, and &#x60;penmanship&#x60; will not. When set to **false**, if the input is &#x60;man&#x60; then &#x60;man&#x60;, &#x60;manpower&#x60;, &#x60;fireman&#x60;, and &#x60;penmanship&#x60; will all match.  This functionality uses the following rules:  - Unless punctuation is specified in the &#x60;anchorString&#x60;, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:    $~&gt;&lt;|^+&#x3D;    For example, the &#x60;anchorString&#x60; &#x60;water&#x60; will match on the string &#x60;Fetch a pail of water.&#x60;  - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.  - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.    Example: If the anchor string is &#x60;forget&#x60;, then an anchor tab is placed on the &#x60;forget&#x60; in &#x60;forget-me-not&#x60;, even when &#x60;anchorMatchWholeWord&#x60; is set to **true**.  - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.  - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.    Example: If the anchor string is &#x60;i&#x60;, then only one anchor tab is placed in &#x60;skiing&#x60;.  - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.    Example: If the anchor string is &#x60;cat&#x60;, then &#x60;-cat-&#x60; is matched but &#x60;1cat2&#x60; is not when &#x60;anchorMatchWholeWord&#x60; is set to **true** (its default value).   **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.
