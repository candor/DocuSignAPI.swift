# NotaryRecipient

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**accessCode** | **String** | If a value is provided, the recipient must enter the value as the access code to view and sign the envelope.   Maximum Length: 50 characters and it must conform to the account&#39;s access code format setting.  If blank, but the signer &#x60;accessCode&#x60; property is set in the envelope, then that value is used.  If blank and the signer &#x60;accessCode&#x60; property is not set, then the access code is not required. | [optional] 
**accessCodeMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**addAccessCodeToEmail** | **String** | Optional. When set to **true**, the access code will be added to the email sent to the recipient. This nullifies the security measure of &#x60;accessCode&#x60; on the recipient. | [optional] 
**additionalNotifications** | [[**RecipientAdditionalNotification**](RecipientAdditionalNotification.md)] |  | [optional] 
**agentCanEditEmail** | **String** | Optional element. When set to **true**, the agents recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient&#39;s pre-populated email address. This element is only active if enabled for the account. | [optional] 
**agentCanEditName** | **String** | Optional element. When set to **true**, the agents recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient&#39;s pre-populated name. This element is only active if enabled for the account. | [optional] 
**allowSystemOverrideForLockedRecipient** | **String** |  | [optional] 
**autoNavigation** | **String** | When set to **true**, autonavigation is set for the recipient.  | [optional] 
**bulkRecipientsUri** | **String** | Reserved for DocuSign. | [optional] 
**canSignOffline** | **String** | When set to **true**, specifies that the signer can perform the signing ceremony offline. | [optional] 
**clientUserId** | **String** | Specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.   If the &#x60;clientUserId&#x60; property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Use this field to associate the signer with their userId in your app. Authenticating the user is the responsibility of your app when you use embedded signing.  Note: if the &#x60;clientUserId&#x60; property is set and either &#x60;SignerMustHaveAccount&#x60; or &#x60;SignerMustLoginToSign&#x60; property of the account settings is set to  **true**, an error is generated on sending.   Maximum length: 100 characters.  | [optional] 
**completedCount** | **String** | Indicates the number of times that the recipient has been through a signing completion for the envelope. If this number is greater than 0 for a signing group, only the user who previously completed may sign again. Read only. | [optional] 
**creationReason** | **String** | The reason why the item was created. | [optional] 
**customFields** | **[String]** | An optional array of strings that enables the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the envelope status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. Each &#x60;customField&#x60; string can be a maximum of 100 characters. | [optional] 
**declinedDateTime** | **String** | The date and time the recipient declined the document. Read only. | [optional] 
**declinedReason** | **String** | The reason the recipient declined the document. Read only. | [optional] 
**defaultRecipient** | **String** | When set to **true**, this recipient is the default recipient and any tabs generated by the transformPdfFields option are mapped to this recipient. | [optional] 
**deliveredDateTime** | **String** | The date and time that the envelope was delivered to the recipient. Read only. | [optional] 
**deliveryMethod** | **String** | Reserved for DocuSign. | [optional] 
**deliveryMethodMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**designatorId** | **String** |  | [optional] 
**designatorIdGuid** | **String** |  | [optional] 
**documentVisibility** | [[**DocumentVisibility**](DocumentVisibility.md)] | A list of &#x60;documentVisibility&#x60; objects. Each object in the list specifies whether a document in the envelope is visible to this recipient. For the envelope to use this functionality, Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the &#x60;enforceSignerVisibility&#x60; property must be set to **true**. | [optional] 
**email** | **String** |  | [optional] 
**emailMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**emailNotification** | [**RecipientEmailNotification**](RecipientEmailNotification.md) |  | [optional] 
**embeddedRecipientStartURL** | **String** | Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender&#39;s system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.   If set to &#x60;SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN&#x60;, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.  It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient&#39;s identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets &#x60;EmbeddedRecipientStartURL&#x3D;SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN&#x60;, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.  If the &#x60;clientUserId&#x60; property is NOT set, and the &#x60;embeddedRecipientStartURL&#x60; is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: &#x60;envelopeId&#x60;, &#x60;recipientId&#x60;, &#x60;recipientName&#x60;, &#x60;recipientEmail&#x60;, and &#x60;customFields&#x60;. The &#x60;customFields&#x60; property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.   *Example*:   &#x60;http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&amp;[[mergeField3]]&#x60;  | [optional] 
**errorDetails** | [**ErrorDetails**](ErrorDetails.md) |  | [optional] 
**excludedDocuments** | **[String]** | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the &#x60;enforceSignerVisibility&#x60; property must be set to **true** for the envelope to use this.  When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. | [optional] 
**faxNumber** | **String** | Reserved for DocuSign. | [optional] 
**faxNumberMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**firstName** | **String** | The user&#39;s first name.  Maximum Length: 50 characters. | [optional]

**fullName** | **String** | Reserved for DocuSign. | [optional] 
**fullNameMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**idCheckConfigurationName** | **String** | The name of the authentication check to use. This value must match one of the authentication types that the account uses. The names of these authentication types appear in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient. This setting overrides any default authentication setting. Valid values are:  - &#x60;Phone Auth $&#x60;: The recipient must authenticate by using two-factor authentication (2FA). You provide the phone number to use for 2FA in the &#x60;phoneAuthentication&#x60; object. - &#x60;SMS Auth $&#x60;: The recipient must authenticate via SMS. You provide the phone number to use in the &#x60;smsAuthentication&#x60; object. - &#x60;ID Check $&#x60;: The  recipient must answer detailed security questions.   **Example**: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available. In the web console Identify list, these appear as ID Check $ and SMS Auth $. To use ID Check in an envelope, the idCheckConfigurationName should be ID Check $. For SMS, you would use SMS Auth $, and you would also need to add a phone number to the smsAuthentication node. | [optional] 
**idCheckConfigurationNameMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**idCheckInformationInput** | [**IdCheckInformationInput**](IdCheckInformationInput.md) |  | [optional] 
**identityVerification** | [**RecipientIdentityVerification**](RecipientIdentityVerification.md) |  | [optional] 
**inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration** | **String** | When set to **true** and the envelope recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings for the recipient&#39;s account.  | [optional]

**recipientId** | **String** | A local reference that senders use to map recipients to other objects, such as specific document tabs. Within an envelope, each &#x60;recipientId&#x60; must be unique, but there is no uniqueness requirement across envelopes. For example, many envelopes assign the first recipient a &#x60;recipientId&#x60; of &#x60;1&#x60;. | [optional] 
**recipientIdGuid** | **String** | The globally-unique identifier (GUID) for a specific recipient on a specific envelope. If the same recipient is associated with multiple envelopes, they will have a different GUID for each one. Read only. | [optional]

**requireIdLookupMetadata** | [**PropertyMetadata**](PropertyMetadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**requireSignerCertificate** | **String** | By default, DocuSign signers create electronic signatures. This field can be used to require the signer to use a SAFE-BioPharma digital certificate for signing.  This parameter should only be used to select a SAFE-BioPharma certificate. New integrations should use the &#x60;recipientSignatureProviders&#x60; parameter for other types of digital certificates.   Set this parameter to &#x60;safe&#x60; to use a SAFE-BioPharma certificate.  The signer must be enrolled in the SAFE program to sign with a SAFE certificate. | [optional] 
**requireSignOnPaper** | **String** | When set to **true**, the signer must print, sign, and upload or fax the signed documents to DocuSign. | [optional]

**signingGroupId** | **String** | Optional. The ID of the [signing group](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-signing-groups).  **Note**: When you send an envelope to a signing group, anyone in the group can open it and sign it with their own signature. For this reason, we recommend that you do not include non-signer recipients (such as carbon copy recipients) in the same signing group as signer recipients. However, you could create a second signing group for the non-signer recipients and change the default action of Needs to Sign to a different value, such as Receives a Copy.  | [optional]
